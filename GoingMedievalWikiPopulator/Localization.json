There might be weird, illogical, even gamebreaking bugs, but rest assured - we plan to fix them ASAP. You might even experience uneven game performance and unexpected crashes - for that we are just asking for patience. We are counting on you and your experience to help us make Going Medieval a really standout game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we move forward, we expect to add more features - weapons, foes, animals, environments while expanding the gameplay and fine-tuning all aspects of the experience. You can easily give feedback while in the game by hitting <style=Shortcut> F10 </style> and capturing the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease share your feedback and thoughts on our <style=Shortcut> Discord server </style> in the Beta channels there. Thanks for being with us on this journey.",

  "pseudonym_info_apostle": "<name> was a follower alright, and loved to go on about the scriptures. [His/Her] proselytising could become a little tiresome and repetitive. When <name> wouldn't shut up, they called [him/her] 'The Apostle'. <name> thought it was a complement.",
  "pseudonym_info_zealot": "<name> keeps making altars and offerings, stopping the day's business to say prayers and muttering about sin. One might be forgiven for saying [he/she] takes it a bit far.",
  "pseudonym_info_heretic": "<name> speaks of the God of Abraham and the mosques of the Moors, of sacred groves, lost scrolls and forbidden rites. <name> knows a bit too much for [his/her] own good.",
  "pseudonym_info_chaste": "<name> is pining for a dead lover, and will never marry another. <name> is living in the past, trying to stop precious memories from slipping away, and shuns all affection.",
  "pseudonym_info_pudding": "<name> could make an excellent fygey pudding, among other desserts. [He/She] never lacked for paramours, being bonny and sweet, with just enough spice. Lovers, rivals and jilted exes all called <name> 'pudding', with varying degrees of affection.",
  "pseudonym_info_forlorn": "When not complaining, <name> was weeping into [his/her] pottage. This was destinctly unappetising. It did not pay to ask <name> why [he/she] was forlorn, since [his/her] tales of woe were so distressing they would haunt your dreams forever.",
  "pseudonym_info_tart": "<name> was not in the least flirtatious. [He/She] got [his/her] nickname thanks to an ascerbic nature, that left a bitter taste even after the briefest of interactions. <name> was the ultimate sourpuss.",
  "pseudonym_info_doctor": "<name> had saved a friend's life at just 10 years old, earning the title of 'doctor'. Less well known was that <name> had abandoned many beseeching patients during the unremitting horror of The Pestilence. It was a title burdened with secret shame.",
  "pseudonym_info_fool": "<name> had at one time played the fool at court, and revelled in being allowed to insult the high and mighty, as long as [he/she] caused enough mirth to compensate. [His/Her] cutting wit and humourous insults were unsurpassed.",
  "pseudonym_info_spy": "<name> had once been bribed by the abbot to listen for compromising secrets at the manor of <origin>. Alas [he/she] had been exposed and disavowed by all concerned. <name> was a pretty useless spy, but to this day, nobody trusted [him/her].",
  "pseudonym_info_deceiver": "As a sailor, <name> offered safe passage to desperate townsfolk attempting to flee the Tide of Death to the Western Isles or Hibernia. Once out at sea, <name> tossed them overboard, stripping their valuables. 'It's just business', <name> shrugged.",

  "pseudonym_info_bonesetter": "<name> had first practiced on animals but soon moved on to human subjects. The way [he/she] hovered [his/her] hands over the damaged limb before giving a sudden, brisk wrench was almost mystical. <name> could not explain how [he/she] did it.",
  "pseudonym_info_wakeful": "<name> could never sleep, so gained a reputation as a good watchman. [His/Her] night vision was highly tuned.",

  "pseudonym_info_philosopher": "<name> once read half a thing, somewhere, maybe, about turning lead into gold. Apparently urine is involved. [He/She] may be taking the piss.",
  "pseudonym_info_lucky": "<name> was born under a lucky horseshoe, so they said. It seemed plausible enough. Money seemed to fall in [his/her] lap, chance encounters led to romance, and the sun always shone on <name>.",
  "pseudonym_info_prodigal": "<name> was a quitter, [he/she] left many a task unfinished. And yet with [his/her] silver tongue, loaded with sweet flattery and plausible excuses, <name> would be welcomed back for seemingly infinite second chances.",
  "pseudonym_info_paramour": "Ugly as a child, <name> would never slight a lady for her looks. And in the wake of Armageddon, the value of good looks as currency was somewhat diminished. <name> helped keep spirits - and skirts - high, gaining a reputation as a satisfying lover.",
  "pseudonym_info_riddler": "Some people talk straight. But <name> had a way with words that certainly sounded clever, but was also a trifle confusing. Many of <name>'s pronouncements could have multiple meanings. [His/Her] friends called [him/her] The Riddler.",
  "pseudonym_info_kitten": "Cute, soft, endearing...<name> is certainly adorable, and people flock to [him/her] to pet [him/her]. But beware, <name> also has claws, and often leaves a trail of destruction behind [him/her].",
  "pseudonym_info_lamb": "<name> was docile and sweet-tempered, and so was often affectionately called lamb. Like most of [his/her] disposition, <name> had learned the hard way to be on guard against wolves.",
  "pseudonym_info_bride": "<name> seemed to be forever stitching away at incredibly fine and delicate items of clothing and linens for [his/her] wedding trousseau. [He/She] became dewy eyed at the prospect of marriage. What a pity, then, that <name> had never even been kissed.",
  "pseudonym_info_thief": "<name> had always been nimble fingered, but became a full-time thief to survive the Dark Years. [He/She] stitched many hidden pockets into [his/her] clothes and would pinch anything that wasn't nailed down. <name> was often hired to do so.",
  "pseudonym_info_pirate": "<name> didn’t do much to deserve [his/her] nickname, [he/she] inherited it. <name> was from a long line of swashbucklers known for attacking and looting trading ships in the waters around British Isles. <name>, however, didn't sail, and couldn't swim.",
  "pseudonym_info_ghost": "<name> was pale and silent and loitered in dark alcoves. <name> seldom spoke, and often seemed to appear out of nowhere, startling people. <name> was actually a bit creepy, seeming to have more in common with the dead than the living.",

  "bg_recent_info_tireless": "<name> got the knack of carpentry fashioning coffins for plague victims, later nailing whole families into their homes to die. Next, <name> built trebuchets in the War of Succession. Fac et aliquid operis, ut semper te diabolus inveniat occupatum!",

  "bg_recent_info_cheerful": "<name> would whistle as [he/she] worked, almost as though the horrors of recent times had passed [him/her] by. <name>'s reason to be cheery was simple enough. [He/She] had caught the pestilence, but had dodged the Grim Reaper. Life was good.",
  "bg_recent_info_charitable": "<name> roved among the mills, begging or stealing flour to bake bread. This [he/she] made into simple bannocks and distributed to the starving village folk, barely clinging to the wreckage of their former lives. It kept <name> busy, and purposeful.",
  "bg_recent_info_avantgarde": "<name> experimented. Have you tried rat au vin or eels in goat's milk? Neither had <name> until Armageddon. [He/She] was utterly fearless in combining random ingredients to keep everyone fed, leading to unexpected results and frequent indigestion.",
  "bg_recent_info_toxic": "<name> fed a band of hungry marauders, a risky job. <name> would occasionaly cut corners to save time. Uncertain if it was a stray toadstool or mouldering rye that caused the hallucinations, <name> still maintained [he/she] did [his/her] best.",
  "bg_recent_info_clever": "<name> believed [him/her]self spared from Mortal Sickness for a higher purpose. So said the Canterbury Friar, who taught [him/her] to read. “Knowledge is freedom”, <name> whispered softly, mounting the Friar’s mule and stealing away into the darkness.",
  "bg_recent_info_inconspicuous": "<name> was deployed undercover to watch for heresy among royalist factions. On receiving no further instructions from [his/her] Master of Whispers, <name> sought the shadows, using what [he/she] heard to survive.",

  "bg_recent_info_patient": "<name> developed patience to sit in a furze bush or atop an oak tree, chewing on a blade of grass and listening to the wind. At the perfect moment, [he/she] would take down [his/her] prey with a single arrow. <name> had become an assassin.",
  "bg_recent_info_deadly": "<name> was on a crusade to wipe out pretentious, usurping commoners and reinstate the true and righteous order of England. Blood mattered, and <name> would reclaim [his/her] birthright. The peasantry needed to be brought to their filthy knees.",
  "bg_recent_info_bloodthirsty": "<name> recalled the healer lancing boils. Flagstones had run red as he opened veins, cursing the French, and the King. Finally <name> took the powders and purifying herbs from the dying healer's blackened hand. <name> was left holding the bloody razor.",
  "bg_recent_info_bookish": "studying the many great works in the libraries of Oxford gave <name> confidence to try [his/her] hand at medicine. <name> was from a worthy family, the last of [his/her] name. Book learning surely surpasses base peasant cures, herbs and charms?",

  "bg_recent_info_thoughtless": "<name> fancied [him/her]self a dressmaker. And so [he/she] set about using miller's floursacks, sheets and linen rags to clothe the destitute orphans and wastrels of <origin>. A frightful sight they were, shorn of their remaining dignity. ",
  "bg_recent_info_reckless": "<name> ventured into the abandoned mines, with a band of comrades and a few candle stubs. It only takes a pickaxe, any fool can do it, <name> supposed. And putting aside the fatal rockfall and the flooding incidents, <name> was right.",
  "bg_recent_info_desolate": "<name> wanted to hit someone, to take out [his/her] rage at the horror and desolation that had violated everything [he/she] loved. But <name> was a pacifist. So [he/she] hacked spoils from the bountiful earth until [his/her] grief was spent instead.",
  "bg_recent_info_solitary": "<name> had felt more at home in the quiet of the clay pits and lime kilns than in the towns. There were traces of humanity, but not the stench or the despair. <name> carved a secret labyrinth into the rock, invoking memories of Reims Cathedral.",

  "bg_old_info_architect": "If truth be told, <name> was jealous of Henry Yeverley. Although [he/she] could never rival the Master Mason of the King's Works, <name> thought [his/her] advanced ideas on architecture, acquired at the Château de Vincennes, worthy of greater renown.",
  "bg_old_info_masterbuilder": "<name> loved getting stuck into a complex project. [He/She] spent many years crossing Europe in search of instruction. <name> understood how to create gravity-defying structures with stone and iron, taught by the nameless, genius cathedral builders.",
  "bg_old_info_engineer": "<name> took pride in the vast engines of war [he/she] designed. <name> dreamed of one day creating a device as legendary as the great Warwolf trebuchet created by Master James of St. George. How the tarbarrels and corpses would fly!",
  "bg_old_info_scribe": "The pen is mightier than the sword, and <name> had certainly reveled in a little power. Called upon to wield [his/her] quill by merchants and gentry, <name> recorded their contracts, their laws and their deaths in littera antiqua, with a flourish.",
  "bg_old_info_monk": "<name> liked to potter in the still room, with [his/her] salves and potions. Those brought to the hospital were truly at the mercy of God. But <name> liked to offer what little curative help [he/she] could to ease their suffering.",

  "bg_old_info_archer": "From being fostered as a squire through to becoming a mounted archer, <name> was a true career soldier. Scarred and surly, [he/she] had kept a cool head at Saint-Omer and Morlaix, escaping without victory but with [his/her] life.",
  "bg_old_info_recruit": "<name> practiced when [he/she] could with the longbow, but ploughing and reaping duties generally took precedence. No matter, <name> was enlisted to fight in France, ending at the Siege of Tournai. A string to [his/her] bow and a tale for the fireside.",
  "bg_old_info_healer": "A cloistered life, tending the abbey gardens and copying fine manuscripts, spun <name> along a golden thread of erudition. Alas, the pitiless Abbott urged [him/her] to go forth and heal the sick and the poor. So, reluctantly, <name>’s exile began.",
  "bg_old_info_fielddoctor": "By day, <name> tended fallen troops. But at night, the rank threat of battlefield dysentery and marsh fever invaded [his/her] sleep. Bad air from bloated corpses was the stuff of nightmares. Of the four horsemen, <name> dreaded pestilence most.",
  "bg_old_info_nun": "<name>'s family paid the church her dowry, granting her a pious and cloistered life. Instead, a small, persistent voice bid her roam over battlefields, stitching up wounds and praying with the broken as they gasped their last. It was <name>'s calling.",
  "bg_old_info_knight": "Chivalry was <name>'s lifeblood, and [he/she] would die for honour. A knight of St John, <name> had become a warrior monk, defended Rhodes from infidels. Loyalty, justice and generosity were [his/her] watchwords, but woe betide the summa culpabilis.",
  "bg_old_info_soldier": "<name> had seen gruesome battles, weak leaders and fearsome foes. Expecting to face death in France, <name> trained constantly and was fighting fit, belligerent and always guarded. We often give our enemies the means of our own destruction.",
  "bg_old_info_armycook": "An army marches on its stomach, and <name> knew how to keep the campfires burning and soldier's bellies full. [His/Her] meals weren't exactly gourmet but <name> was a keen butcher, and could fillet the opposition pretty skillfuly in retreat.",
  "bg_old_info_mercenary": "<name> had roamed Italy causing the worst kinds of trouble with the Company of St George, a group of freemen whose goal was pillaging and chaos. All good things must end, and <name> had subsequently dug ditches and escaped hanging for petty thievery.",
  "bg_old_info_farrier": "<name> is a horse whisperer. [He/She] keeps equine hooves healthy and shod in iron. It doesn't pay much, but it's a stable job.",
  "bg_old_info_lorimer": "<name> has furrows of concentration etched on [his/her] brow, and brawny arms from working hammer and bellows. Whether a humble horse bit or a knight's spurs, <name> could craft them.",
  "bg_old_info_blacksmith": "Broad and taciturn, <name> believed [his/her] art helped forge Anglalonde, aided by the gods. 'Weland gave the Sword, The Sword gave the Treasure, and the Treasure gave the Law,' so it was said. And <name> repeated that often, to any who listened.",
  "bg_old_info_armourer": "<name> could bend anything to [his/her] will, especially bright metal. Formerly apprentice to a master from Chartres, <name>'s hammer and nimble fingers had worked long years in the armouries of the London arsenal. [He/She] had saved countless lives.",
  "bg_old_info_arrowsmith": "Tipped with blade or barbed, <name> had been turning out arrow heads since [he/she] was 14. [He/She] sometimes wondered how many of [his/her] creations had found their mark, staining the ruddy battlefields of Sluys and Crecy.",
  "bg_old_info_barber": "Need a close shave? When it was time to remove a troublesome beard or festering limb, <name> would merrily oblige. [He/She] loved to gossip almost as much as letting blood. <name> was often the first to know, and, for many, the last they would see.",
  "bg_old_info_courtesan": "<name> speaks soft and low, with a gentle laugh as pleasing as birdsong. Despite being a great storyteller, nobody knows [his/her] chequered history at court. However, <name> knows a tasty little secret about almost everyone else...",
  "bg_old_info_alchemist": "<name> had become disillusioned questing for the Philosopher's Stone, and sought the Elixir of Youth. [He/She] could read Greek and Arabic and made copious notes in code. <name> occasionally despaired, [his/her] dreams reduced to glittering dross.",
  "bg_old_info_peddler": "Traveller <name> carried needful supplies on [his/her] back like a snail, toiling between remote hamlets. The insular indwellers were always suspicious. Each time, <name> sweet-talked them into trusting [him/her], so that the bargaining could begin.",
  "bg_old_info_tanner": "<name> knew how to tan a hide with an animal's own brains, and with the alchemy of wood ash, excrement and festering bark. Without <name>, no one would have shoes, armour or saddles. But [he/she] was hardly popular. As jobs go, <name>'s really stank.",
  "bg_old_info_cordwainer": "<name> entered the Cordwainers' Guild by patrimony - 'Corio et Arte' had been [his/her] father's favourite refrain. The scent of leather revived unbidden memories of London ateliers in the shadow of St Paul's, bustling with shoemakers like <name>.",
  "bg_old_info_armorer": "<name> began with cuir bouilli, leather boiled in wax and sturdy enough to give a commoner some battlefield protection. Later [he/she] progressed to Brigandine armour, riveting on metal plate to shield the heart. <name> was also serviceable with a bow.",
  "bg_old_info_cobbler": "Hailing from <origin>, <name> liked to roam up over the downs and through the ferny holloways of England. Villagers always welcomed [him/her], as even the most humble carl or cotter had shoes for <name> to mend. ",
  "bg_old_info_miner": "<name> had done [his/her] time in the Low Peak lead fields and the Welsh mines of the Black Prince. Pale and shunning daylight like many miners, <name> had hollow eyes and headaches. Glistening veins of gold caressed [his/her] dreams.",
  "bg_old_info_franklin": "Tilling lynchets into the poor, hilly soil near <origin> had been a last resort as fertile land was scarce. But <name> had done well, and won the freedom to farm their own hide. <name> felt pride, but mainly relief. [He/She] soldiered on.",
  "bg_old_info_carter": "<name> got sick of shoveling dung with the reeve looking over [his/her] shoulder. And sicker still of the miserable husbandman who didn't pay fair and square in ale when <name> unloaded it onto the fields. At least [he/she] had a strong back.",
  "bg_old_info_gravedigger": "<name> dug the graves at <origin> churchyard. But it was on the bloodied field at Crécy that [he/she] did [his/her] finest work. To crack French skulls in a ditch hewn with the very same pickaxe gave <name> endless satisfaction.",
  "bg_old_info_berner": "<name> was top dog, the leader of the pack. [He/She] cared for the hounds, and in return these dogs were fiercely loyal. Although not of high rank, <name> commanded respect. Hounds can be ferocious when crossed.",
